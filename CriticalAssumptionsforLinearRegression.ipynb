        "- Regression is a parametric approach where one makes assumptions of data for analysis.\n",
        "- Successful regression analysis requires validation of the assumptions made.\n",
        "- The dependent or the response variable and the independent or the predictor variable have a linear and additive relationship\n",
        "- For a predictor variable X and a response variable Y\n",
        "- A Linear relationship implies that a change in response Y due to one unit change in X remains constant.\n",
        "1. In additive relationship, the effect of X on the response Y is independent of the other variables.\n",
        "2. Error terms are normally distributed.\n",
        "3. Independent variables are NOT correlated\n",
        "- Multicollinearity between independent variables does not exist.\n",
        "4. Error or residual terms are NOT correlated\n",
        "- If Autocorrelation is absent.\n",
        "5. The error terms have constant variance\n",
        "- i.e. they show homoscedasticity\n",

        "- The presenceof non-constant variance is called heteroscedasticity\n"
